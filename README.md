# Server-Side Rendered ToDo Application

## Description of the Assignment
This project involves the development of a server-side rendered ToDo application, featuring functionalities such as authentication, mailing, and user interaction. Users can log in, create, edit, and delete tasks, allowing them to effectively manage their daily activities. By using server-side rendering, we can offer a fast and responsive user experience, with pages dynamically assembled on the server before being sent to the browser. This results in improved load times and SEO performance.

## About the Application
The ToDo application provides users with a secure and efficient way to manage their tasks. Authentication is implemented to ensure users can access their personal task lists securely, including features for registering new accounts, logging in with existing credentials, and managing sessions to maintain user identity. A key aspect of this application is the integration of email functionality, which allows users to receive notifications about important events, such as the addition or completion of tasks. This enhances the user experience by keeping users informed about their tasks.
